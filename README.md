# CRM Automation Lab

Enterprise-style CRM workflow automation and integration patterns.

This repository simulates real-world CRM automation architecture across lead scoring, opportunity validation, and API integration layers.

---

## Architecture Overview

CRM Automation Lab is structured into modular components:

- **Lead Scoring Engine**
- **Opportunity Stage Validation**
- **CRM API Integration Simulation**
- **Unit Testing Layer**

---

## Modules

### 1️⃣ Lead Scoring Engine
Implements weighted scoring logic based on:
- Industry type  
- Company size  
- Engagement score  

**Location:**  
`lead-scoring/`

---

### 2️⃣ Opportunity Validation Module
Simulates stage-based CRM workflow validation logic.

**Location:**  
`opportunity-validation/`

---

### 3️⃣ Integration Layer
Simulates REST-style CRM API behavior for:
- Creating leads  
- Updating leads  
- Retrieving leads  

**Location:**  
`integration-layer/`
